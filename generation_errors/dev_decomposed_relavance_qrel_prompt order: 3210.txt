q6 0 p3170 Based on the query "what did Nato mean by mutual defense", I would rate the relevance of the passages as follows:

* None of the passages are relevant to the query.

The passages appear to be a list of plugin products from Waves, a audio software company. None of the passages mention Nato or mutual defense. The query is unrelated to the topics discussed in the passages.

q40 0 p3170 Based on the provided passage, I would rate the relevance of each passage to the query "what is secom" as follows:

* Score: 0 (Irrelevant)
q40 0 p6694 Based on the passage, I would rate its relevance to the query "what is secom" as 0. The passage does not mention "secom" at all, and it appears to be a collection of UNESCO World Heritage Sites from around the world. The query is likely a typo or a mistake, and the passage does not provide any information that is relevant to the query.
q10 0 p3170 Based on the query and passage, I would rate the relevance of the passage as 0, as it does not seem to be related to the query "why do pilots purposely fly low".

q3 0 p8555 Based on the query "what does FRQ stand for in the workplace" and the passage provided, I would rate the relevance as 0 (Irrelevant). The passage does not mention FRQ or any workplace-related information. The passage appears to be a collection of news releases from MannKind Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company, and does not provide any information about FRQ or its meaning in the workplace.
q3 0 p3170 Based on the provided data, I'll rate the relevance of each passage to the query "what does FRQ stand for in the workplace".

Since none of the passages match the query, I'll rate them as follows:

* All passages: 0/3 (Irrelevant)

The passages are unrelated to the query, and none of them mention FRQ or its meaning in the workplace.
q3 0 p6429 The passage is dedicated to the query.

q39 0 p10888 I would rate this passage as a 0, as it is completely irrelevant to the query "What is the number of breast cancer deaths in the UK annually?" The passage appears to be a list of dates, and does not provide any information related to breast cancer deaths in the UK.

q48 0 p5207 0

The passage is about gender and sexuality, and it discusses the differences between sex and gender, as well as the various gender categories and identities. The query is about whether older adults can gain strength by training once a week, which is not related to the topic of the passage at all. Therefore, I would rate the relevance of the passage to the query as 0.
