q40 0 p3170 Based on the provided list of plugins and their relevance to the query "what is secom", I would rate the relevance of each plugin as follows:

* None of the plugins have a direct relevance to the query "what is secom", as none of them are related to the term "secom".

This is because the passage is a list of plugin products from Waves, and none of the plugins seem to be related to the query "why do pilots purposely fly low". The query is about aviation and flying, while the passage is about audio processing and music production. There is no apparent connection between the two.

Therefore, I would rate it as irrelevant and score it a 0.
