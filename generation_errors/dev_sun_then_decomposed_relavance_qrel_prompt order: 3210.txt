q6 0 p3170 Based on the provided list of plugins, I would rate the relevance of the passage to the query "what did Nato mean by mutual defense" as 0. This is because none of the plugins mentioned in the list have any relation to NATO, mutual defense, or international relations. The list appears to be a collection of audio plugins, and the query is unrelated to audio processing or music production.

q40 0 p3170 Based on the provided list of plugins, I would rate the relevance of the passage to the query "what is secom" as 0.

q3 0 p8555 0

The passage does not contain any information about "FRQ" or "FRQ stand for in the workplace". The passage appears to be a collection of news releases from MannKind Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company, and does not provide any relevant information to the query.
q3 0 p3170 Based on the provided list of plugins, I would rate the relevance of the passage to the query "what does FRQ stand for in the workplace" as 0. This is because none of the plugins mentioned in the list have any relation to the query, which appears to be a question about a term used in the workplace. The plugins listed are all audio processing tools, and none of them have any connection to the query.
