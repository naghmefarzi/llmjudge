        Passage: Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%). These systems may be cheaper to buy, but they are more expensive to have installed: the wires need to be hidden away, so labour costs are higher. Find out more about the installation process, and the costs, by visiting our guide to choosing a burglar alarm installer.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: This has the effect of reducing the forward resistance. So, overall, a gas turbine engine is more fuel efficient when operated at higher altitudes than nearer to the surface. Now that I have explained why it is more efficient for a plane to fly at a higher cruising altitude, what then limits a plane to fly higher than this normal cruising altitude? On a Boeing 777, the maximum service ceiling (altitude at which the maximum rate of climb is reduced to around 100 feet/min) or aircraft*s certification altitude is 43,100 feet.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: Nap-of-the-earth ( NOE) is a type of very low-altitude flight course used by military aircraft to avoid enemy detection and attack in a high-threat environment. During NOE flight, geographical features are used as cover, exploiting valleys and folds in the terrain by flying in, rather than over, them. This keeps below enemy air defence radar coverage, avoiding being silhouetted against the sky.

        Passage: Most NOE flying is done during the day using visual reference by pilots who are experienced in low flying. Data from a radar altimeter or terrain-following radar system is also used, the latter enabling low flying in adverse weather where it would not be possible by visual reference and manual pilot control.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: While aircraft are suppose to stay clear of flying below the 1,000ft/500ft minimum safe altitude limit (except during takeoff/landing of course) there shouldn’t be any close calls if everyone is following the rules since drone pilots are suppose to fly under 400ft. But this app is helpful for me because I have seen police helicopters flying in my city at very low altitudes for whatever reason and I don’t want to cause any confusion like the one some New York drone pilots experienced.

        Passage: Flying IFR is not always the shortest route between two points. Unlike VFR flights IFR happens usually within controlled airspace and requires filing a flight plan (usually) ahead of time. The routing is not completely at the pilot’s discretion. Established waypoints and airways have to be used and the altitude for the flight is determined by things like minimum airway altitude, minimum radar vectoring altitude (MRVA) and traffic situation.

        Passage: The altitude engine allows aircraft to fly at higher altitudes at full power, and increases the aircraft's speed and efficiency, because true airspeed increases with altitude. It also allows an aircraft under IFR to fly at higher MEAs or under VFR over higher terrain, and allows the pilot to choose a favorable altitude for weather. The first kind of altitude engine is called a turbocharged engine, which can generate more intake manifold pressure than at sea level.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: Nap-of-the-earth ( NOE) is a type of very low-altitude flight course used by military aircraft to avoid enemy detection and attack in a high-threat environment. During NOE flight, geographical features are used as cover, exploiting valleys and folds in the terrain by flying in, rather than over, them. This keeps below enemy air defence radar coverage, avoiding being silhouetted against the sky.

During migration, though, birds gain altitude, and many species fly at 2,000 to 5,000 feet or higher, using prevailing winds to assist them. A bird may begin migration at about 5,000 feet and slowly climb to 20,000 feet. Birds can fly higher as they become lighter.

        Passage: This has resulted in a rather complicated system of Categories, Classes, and Sets, which are defined by an aircraft's configuration and capabilities. Initially, Sport Pilots are limited to flying aircraft that are very similar to the ones they trained and took their checkrides in. However, additional privileges can be earned once you're certified. Again, the idea is to assure that Sport Pilots fly aircraft that are very similar to the ones they have received training in. Additional privileges can be earned by undergoing additional training (and in some cases, additional testing) for endorsements that will give you the ability to fly a wider variety of aircraft.

The move bodes well for the future of classical music radio in the Bay Area, but it comes at a price. In the near future, at least, KDFC's signal strength will make it difficult or impossible for many listeners to receive - especially in the South Bay.

Adult contemporary, the format for almost all of her carriers, has gone into decline, with programmers preferring newer, more up-tempo music—less Fleetwood Mac and more Katy Perry. From 2007 to last year, the number of adult contemporary stations fell from 660 to 600, according to Insideradio.com. Soft adult contemporary, the even milder variant, lost more than half its stations, dropping from 242 to 115.

        Passage: Gender And Sexuality | Anthropology | Chegg Tutors. Show Transcript. hi guys my name is Katherine I'm one of the tutors here at Chegg usually I tutor science and some English but today we are going to do a sociology lesson which does have a science basis and we are going to be talking about gender and sex so a lot of people think that gender and sex are two words for the same thing and in the way that we use them a lot in society that can be true but they actually mean two totally different things so first we're going to talk about sex sex is a biological thing if you run enough tests on a newborn baby you can know their sex so when somebody is female they have 46 chromosomes and the two sex chromosomes are both what's called X chromosomes and typically what happens is the chromosomes that you have determine the genitals that your body makes and the hormones that it produces - so if you're female and you're you are 46 xx you will produce a lot of hormones like estrogen and estradiol and progesterone and the genitals that you'll get will be things like the labia and the clitoris on the outside and the vagina and the fallopian tubes on the inside if you're male you also have 46 chromosomes but you have one X and one y sex chromosome so the hormones that your body will make are things like testosterone and DHT and the genitals that you get will be things like the penis scrotum and testes but if you are paying attention you heard that I said that's what usually happens there's a whole other group of people who are called intersex and they are people usually where there's been a mismatch between their internal and external genitals so there are four types of intersex people the first are people who are 46 XY if you are paying attention over here we said before that people who are 46 why are people who are female right but these people have a really enlarged clitoris and labia and what ends up happening is they fuse together and they make something that looks more like a penis if somebody is 46 X Y they may have some sort of they could have some sort of like in incomplete external genitalia it could be ambiguous or it could look just completely female and on the inside their testes might be malformed they might be perfectly typical or they could be completely absent but they're still XY the third type of intersex people are what's called true gonad all intersex these people could have XX in some parts of their body or X and X Y in others they could have all of one type throughout their body but what characterizes them and what like separates them from the other types of intersex people is that they have both testicle and I think ovarian tissue let me just double check yes ovarian an testicle - testicular tissue it's always good to make sure that you know that you're telling people the right thing especially when you're a tutor but anyways so the fourth type of intersex is complex or undetermined intersex individuals so these are people who don't have 46 XX or 46 XY they could be 45 X so they're just missing an X chromosome it could be X X X they could be X X Y um they cannot be just Y turns out you need at least one Y chromosome in order sorry at least one X chromosome in order to survive but other than that there they can be all sorts of different mixtures and these people don't have a mismatch between their internal and external genitals but they do have some sort of hormonal issues and that can lead to issues later with sexual development and so okay so this thus far that is sex that's completely biological if you run enough tests on a newborn baby you can find out if they're XX or XY take off your third diaper and you see what their genitals look like you can figure it out what somebody's sex is at birth gender on the other hand is way more complicated so before we talk about what gender is we're going to talk about what gender is not so gender is not just having certain genitals and we know that because if you were to get into a really bad accident tomorrow and you were to lose your genitals because it was so awful um you you might be you know very upset and rightly so but you would still be you if you had a penis um and then you lost it you wouldn't say oh crap now I'm a woman like that was the only reason I was male that the only reason I was a man you know that's not true so sexy oh sorry gender can't just be genitals we also know it's not just chromosomes because people don't really know what their chromosomes are you know there's the Shania Twain song and it doesn't go I feel like an xx individual you have to there's an inside feeling of like oh no it's it's more than just that because there's no way to base your identity on a piece of information that you don't have and because of these two things it's also not if you're not able to tell what gender somebody is with a scientific test so what gender is is a performance in the context of the culture that you live in and another way of saying that is that it's a social construct and a lot of people get kind of like tripped up with that they say that that almost makes it sound like it's not real like a social construct is just we made up and it is true that we like made it up enough that we created it as a society but that doesn't make it not real ah there are a lot of other social constructs let's see I am American and that comes with the whole slew of like different ideas about work and about family and about like what makes a life well-lived and I have my place within that American society it's a place that I've determined for myself and even if I don't have all of the words to express it it's an intrinsic part of me now what it means for me to be an American we also know that gender is incredibly complicated in the same way that I don't have all of the words to talk about how I am American I don't have all of the words to talk about how I am a woman um sidenote because I don't think I said this explicitly man and woman those are two examples of gender words rather than sex words and you know what those things are even if you don't know how to say it often ah so one of my favorite sexologists that means a doctor who studies sex who talks about that is a woman named dr. lindsey doe and she describes the way we think about gender and the way we talk about gender is a lot like the way that mapmakers thought and talked about the world in the 1500s we're super curious we want to know the answers but we just don't have enough tools right now to do all of the work so she says if you want to put it in her fantastic wording um myself down there sometimes we have the words but not a complete sense of a concept for example gender performance roles and script other times we have concepts but not the words to realize them gender is the complex sets of how an individual relates to and identifies with multiple or no gender categorizations and there are a lot of gender categorizations and that's what will mostly be talking about now is what some of those more common ones are but there are way more than we could ever discuss in this video some people think that there's one gender categorization for every person out there um and that if there are so many if it's just an individual thing why describe them at all those are incredibly interesting questions but they are for another day so we're going to present you with three individuals right here this first one this is an xx individual so we remember before that if you're xx you are female so this X oops this access individual says I feel like a woman and this makes sense in our brains right xx female female individuals are often women but then look at this person they're XY and they also say I feel like a woman too um and that doesn't quite match up in our brains because you know XY is male and male we often associate with men and finally we've got this person over here they're xx and they say they don't feel like a woman um they don't say that they feel like a man but they don't feel like a woman so it's not possible just based on that to say exactly what everybody's gender is in this picture but what we can say is that this lady over here and we'll call her la because she says she feels like a woman and she's got two X chromosomes and hopefully that's ok with this stick figure she's what's called cisgendered what that means so sis is a Latin prefix that means on the same side we kind of line up like I said before female with woman and male with man so the female part of her is on the same side as the woman in our chart that makes her cisgendered this person right here he well who shoot that was a mistake this person doesn't have any so I shouldn't have said he because they say they feel like a woman so I probably should have said she um and if this person feels like a woman and is if they go around saying I'm a woman but they have an X Y that makes them something that instead is called transgender one sec actually I made a tiny mistake here it's cisgender not cisgendered because it said it's a actually I don't know why but it's transgender not transgendered um so it's Oh cuz it's an adjective but anyhow um this person is transgender and this person over here we are not so sure because they could also be transgender they could be some other gender that we'll talk about in a minute they could have no gender at all but something that we do know is that this person is this gender and that both of these lovely folks over here or what is called gender queer basically that just means they are not cisgendered so what we'll talk about next is almost sorts of different genderqueer people so the person in the middle over here this woman she is transgender so there's a lot of different words for talking about people who are transgender so the first two we just talked about trans and sis so trans meaning on the opposite side sis meaning on the same side so if somebody is female and they are a woman or they're male and they're a man they are cisgendered but if they are female and they're a man or they're male and they're a woman then they're transgendered so these next four ones the MTF FTM MTM and ft are just different ways of talking about that idea so if somebody is MTF what that means if somebody is MTF that means that they are a male to female transgendered person this woman right here is a fantastic example of that they have an X chromosome and a Y meaning they're biologically male but at the same time they are a woman it's a little tricky because male to female sounds like they're changing their sex instead of their gender but this is the word that existed when we started to think of this terminology so that's what we still use today so this here this is two so you might be able to guess that this one here if somebody's FTM they're female to male transgender person but look I just said that language is not super great because this person wasn't male and now they're female they're just male and also a woman or the second person here they're not they weren't female and now they're male they're both female and a man so that language isn't super great so now people use what's called MTM and FTF male to male or female to female so if somebody like this person right here is ourn you know he's a man and he feels now as if you know his outside and his inside don't quite match he probably has like a vagina and a clitoris and a uterus but those things he feels are incorrect they're not right and so he makes this transition but it's wrong to say that he was a woman and now he's becoming a man so instead what this person might say is that they're a male to male transgender person and that MTM stands for this change is just supposed to show that what's changing is it's a it's a better realization of who that person is rather than it being a change in sex it's not even a change in gender it's more it's a better expression to the rest of the world about what their gender always was it's the same thing here with MTF this person might consider themselves FTF instead that way it's just a better understanding of who they are or a better presentation of who they are to the rest of the world to the public so all of these terms thus far have been for people who are born with one sex and they feel that they are the one gender that usually does not go with that but what about people who are not like that so the first all of these have or the first three over here of these genderqueer folk have really easy prefixes that make it easy to figure out what they are so first a means a lack of something so an atheist is somebody who does not believe in any sort of God something that's amorphous doesn't have any sort of shape and somebody who's a gender doesn't have a gender they still have a sex they could be male they could be female they could be intersex but they don't consider themselves a man or a woman they disconcert themselves not or perhaps just neutral on that a by gender person on the other hand by means to write like a bicycle has two wheels by gender people are two genders they that's not the same thing though as being transgender which is an easy mistake to make instead these people are both male or ooh sorry they're both a man and a woman or some other gender they are two genders either both at the same time or they are two genders at different times of the day week month or year they don't fully identity identify with just one gender next you have poly gender poly means many and somebody who's poly gender will feel like many genders all at the same time or at different times of the day month weaker year so for example they may occasionally feel as if they are a gender and then later fully male or fully woman um there are they may be both woman and a third gender which we don't really go into all that much in this video but there are other genders than the ones we're talking about here and finally our folk who are two-spirit so this is something that yeah is from indigenous cultures in the United States I'm not sure if it's anywhere else and because I don't know a ton about it I'm just going to read straight off um because I certainly don't want to get somebody's gender wrong in some indigenous cultures in the u.s. a person who identified with both male and female gender roles was called two-spirit meaning that they have both the spirit of a man and one of a woman unlike many transgender people in the u.s. today people who were two-spirit were typically viewed positively and seen as having a strength which their society benefit from benefited from so there you go if you are learning all of this for a class and it seems complicated and difficult I can't emphasize enough that it is so worth your time it is gender is a fascinating thing to talk about and the more you learn the more interesting it is so the one other thing I wanted to do is a good researcher always shows her sources and super important so none of what we talked about today would tell you who a person is interested in having relationships with how many relationships they would want to be in if any at all or what those relationships look like that's all part of what's called sexuality and that is the topic for another video so hope you enjoyed this lesson and that you have a wonderful day.
