        Passage: Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%). These systems may be cheaper to buy, but they are more expensive to have installed: the wires need to be hidden away, so labour costs are higher. Find out more about the installation process, and the costs, by visiting our guide to choosing a burglar alarm installer.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: This has the effect of reducing the forward resistance. So, overall, a gas turbine engine is more fuel efficient when operated at higher altitudes than nearer to the surface. Now that I have explained why it is more efficient for a plane to fly at a higher cruising altitude, what then limits a plane to fly higher than this normal cruising altitude? On a Boeing 777, the maximum service ceiling (altitude at which the maximum rate of climb is reduced to around 100 feet/min) or aircraft*s certification altitude is 43,100 feet.

Alternatively, those same pilots may fly super slow to stick it to the company by arriving late.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: Nap-of-the-earth ( NOE) is a type of very low-altitude flight course used by military aircraft to avoid enemy detection and attack in a high-threat environment. During NOE flight, geographical features are used as cover, exploiting valleys and folds in the terrain by flying in, rather than over, them. This keeps below enemy air defence radar coverage, avoiding being silhouetted against the sky.

        Passage: Most NOE flying is done during the day using visual reference by pilots who are experienced in low flying. Data from a radar altimeter or terrain-following radar system is also used, the latter enabling low flying in adverse weather where it would not be possible by visual reference and manual pilot control.

        Passage: These deploy after the ordnance is released, slowing its fall and abbreviating its forward trajectory, giving the aircraft time to get clear of the blast zone when bombing from low altitudes or with nuclear ordnance. However, these bombs are less accurate than conventional free-fall bombs.

        Passage: The sensation of speed is not felt at altitude, but when you are sunk down between two canyons at 450kts that is another story. The cool thing about Mach Loop, and why so many photographers climb those steep, muddy hills and often camp out to capture the action, is the variety of aircraft that flies by.

        Passage: Advertisement. The whole area sits under Low Flying Area 7, and because of the terrain, fighters, trainers, helicopters, and even transports use the canyons to hone their low-level flying abilities. Although it is clearly one of the most thrilling things one can do in military aviation, flying low over the ground still has its tactical advantages when it comes to avoiding radar and other sensor systems.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: While aircraft are suppose to stay clear of flying below the 1,000ft/500ft minimum safe altitude limit (except during takeoff/landing of course) there shouldn’t be any close calls if everyone is following the rules since drone pilots are suppose to fly under 400ft. But this app is helpful for me because I have seen police helicopters flying in my city at very low altitudes for whatever reason and I don’t want to cause any confusion like the one some New York drone pilots experienced.

        Passage: Introduction to the Mach Loop. The Mach Loop is a set of valleys, situated between Dolgellau in the north, and Machynlleth in the south (and from which the Mach Loop gets its name), which are regularly used for low level flight training, with flying as low as 250 feet (76 metres) from the nearest terrain. To the south of the Mach Loop there is an area called Tactical Training Area 7T, in which, at specified times, the aircraft may fly as low as 100 feet (30.5 Metres).

In the Italo-Turkish War of 1911, the first heavier-than-air craft began dropping bombs on enemy positions. Only a few years later, massive bombers could take off from German-controlled airfields and drop their bombs on London, even as swarms of fighters and attack planes tangled over the Western Front.

        Passage: Such a propeller works as does the high and low gearshift in an automobile. The pilot takes off in the "low," climbs to the altitude at which he wishes to fly, then shifts into "high," for speed in level flight, or moderate climb. And so it goes through all the intricate phases of getting ready a flight.

The B-52s were restricted to bombing suspected Communist bases in relatively uninhabited sections, because their potency approached that of a tactical nuclear weapon.

        Passage: Low-level flying is a highly valued and vital skill for military aircrew, and the Royal Air Force uses several areas of the United Kingdom for low-level flight training. The United Kingdom is split into 18 different low flying areas, or also known as “LFAs”, the LFA’s being numbered 1-19 (Strangely there is no LFA15).

        Passage: Tactical Air Command wanted an aircraft which could operate from shorter runways. They also required a longer ferry range as overseas deployments by F-100s were often limited by refuelling problems. The aircraft would also be optimized for very low-level penetration, including a final 370 km dash at Mach 1.2.

        Passage: Also, when the airspace is crowded, aircraft may spend time flying a holding pattern at relatively low altitude in order to ensure a suitable flow of traffic. This may make is seem as though they are flying lower than usual. In general, air traffic is restricted by local airspace limitations.

        Passage: Why can't airplanes reduce their engine power until they reach higher altitudes? Aircraft need more engine power in order to attain a safe level of flight. Also, if aircraft fly at lower power levels they will remain closer to the ground for longer periods of time, thus more noise exposure to larger area.

        Passage: The only reason aircraft would be flying low enough for you to see the faces of the pilots is if they were about to land. In this case, the aircraft should be directly over the runway and not near any residential areas Therefore, it is unlikely that the aircraft would ever be that close.

        Passage: The low flying aircraft may be able to avoid enemy radar. A large Drop Zone (DZ) is usually required. For mass combat drops, troops are normally dropped below 300 metres (1000 feet). The disadvantage is that the slow, low flying aircraft are much more vulnerable to anti aircraft fire.

        Passage: There are lots of reasons for this. But the single most important one is that it flies at low altitudes and low airspeeds. Going low and slow is not only beautiful, it's also safer. In addition, our design gives the pilot more control than any other type of lighter-than-air aircraft.

        Passage: Flying IFR is not always the shortest route between two points. Unlike VFR flights IFR happens usually within controlled airspace and requires filing a flight plan (usually) ahead of time. The routing is not completely at the pilot’s discretion. Established waypoints and airways have to be used and the altitude for the flight is determined by things like minimum airway altitude, minimum radar vectoring altitude (MRVA) and traffic situation.

        Passage: The altitude engine allows aircraft to fly at higher altitudes at full power, and increases the aircraft's speed and efficiency, because true airspeed increases with altitude. It also allows an aircraft under IFR to fly at higher MEAs or under VFR over higher terrain, and allows the pilot to choose a favorable altitude for weather. The first kind of altitude engine is called a turbocharged engine, which can generate more intake manifold pressure than at sea level.

        Query: why do pilots purposely fly low
        Passage: Nap-of-the-earth ( NOE) is a type of very low-altitude flight course used by military aircraft to avoid enemy detection and attack in a high-threat environment. During NOE flight, geographical features are used as cover, exploiting valleys and folds in the terrain by flying in, rather than over, them. This keeps below enemy air defence radar coverage, avoiding being silhouetted against the sky.
