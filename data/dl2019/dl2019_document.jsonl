A male however, live for only about 10-20 days.here are four stages to a mosquitoes live. These are egg, larval, pupa and adult.

Once the rock has been weakened and broken up by weathering it is ready for erosion. Erosion happens when rocks and sediments are picked up and moved to another place by ice, water, wind or gravity. Mechanical weathering physically breaks up rock. One example is called frost action or frost shattering. Water gets into cracks and joints in bedrock.
