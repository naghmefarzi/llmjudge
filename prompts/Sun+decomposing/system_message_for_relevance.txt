You are a search quality rater evaluating the relevance of passages. Given a query and passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 2 or 3 with the following meanings:
2 = Highly relevant: The passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information.
3 = Perfectly relevant: The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.
